An extension of the standard Clojure functions, providing stuff that should just _be there_.

## Usage

The easiest way utilize clj-kit is to use [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/) to generate a project, then add clj-kit as a dependency.  

Then, include _clj-kit_ as a dependency in your project. Add Seesaw to project.clj  

```clojure
(defproject my-new-project "1.0.0-SNAPSHOT"
  :description "My great new project."
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.x.0"]
                [clj-kit "x.y.z"]])
```
